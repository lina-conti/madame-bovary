# ðŸ‘’ Madame Bovary NLG system
University lab work implementing a seq2seq model for natural language generation (NLG)

## Presentation

This is an M2 university project by [Lina Conti](https://github.com/lina-conti) and [Isaac Murphy](https://github.com/isaac-murphy) for the Advanced Machine Learning course.

The task consisted in filling in a canvas provided by the professor to implement a sequence-to-sequence LSTM-based model to predict the continuation of any paragraph in the style of Flaubert's Madame Bovary.

This work was submitted in December 2022.
